## React Components Example

###### This code provides a simple example of React components to create a user card with a disclaimer. The card showcases a user's information and skills.

# Components

1. App: The main component that composes the user card. It includes an Avatar, Disclaimer, Intro, and SkillList.

2. Avatar: Displays an image (woman.avif) with alt text "katlego moima."

3. Intro: Presents the user's name and a short bio, indicating their interest in software development and coding.

4. SkillList: Lists the user's skills, each represented by a Skill component.

5. Skill: Represents individual skills, including the skill name, an emoji, and a background color.

6. Disclaimer: Displays a disclaimer stating that the card is for learning purposes, and the image used is not owned by the user.

## Copy and paste the CSS code into your project's index.css file to style the components as defined in your React components. The CSS code includes styles for the card, avatar, user information, skills, and the disclaimer. It also includes specific styles for each skill based on its name.

Feel free to adjust the styles as needed to match your design preferences.

# Running the Code
